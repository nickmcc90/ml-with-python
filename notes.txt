- Other models and techniques for regression using Scikit-learn
- Applying linear regression to other datasets.


The problem at hand is that you are the lead data scientist for ACME
insurance. They task you with creating an automated dollar amount that
accurately tells the customer based on several of their characterists
how much they are likely to pay for an annual cost for insurance. We are
given a csv file.

Let's start by downloading the data set.

---------------------

1. We import the csv url and assign it to a variable.
medical_charges_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JovianML/opendatasets/master/data/medical-charges.csv'

2. We import urlretrieve to be able to create a dataframe from the url.
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

3. We use urlretrieve, take the url and download it to a file called 'medical.csv'
urlretrieve(medical_charges_url, 'medical.csv')

4. Know we install pandas
pip install pandas --quiet

And import it in our file.
import pandas as pd
